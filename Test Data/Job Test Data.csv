Marked as a top choice with the response: I recall Mutual of Omaha's Wild America from the late '80s; what a fantastic show that made a lasting impression on me.

Position has reopened after previous hire took a role with her former boss to run a BU



Salary upper 200s, 30% bonus, 3yr vest RSUs at 30% of salary



This is a role to build Marketing within the organization, show them what good looks like



Role needed b/c competition is tougher. #1 in space is Lineage, and there are a number of small ankle-biter companies too. Americold didn't have to rely on marketing in past b/c business just called them up; don't get that as much now due to competition.



Role reports to President (and likely future CEO), Rob Chambers. Most functions report to him except for C-suite (although recently promoted COO reports to him).



Team is 15 people now; likely to grow in future



North America is 70% of business



Company went public in 2018 and haven't had a brand refresh since then

6/23/25 - Chris responded to an email noting that he would be discussing the role with Rob the next day and would let me know something soon.



6/30/25 - Chris emailed that Rob Chambers has put the role on hold until Q4 (they're on a calendar fiscal). Chris will reach out if plans change. I responded by thanking him for the update and proposing a consulting engagement if there are any critical marketing projects on hold b/c of the hiring freeze."
